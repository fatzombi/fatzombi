I'm currently working at [Stratum Security](https://stratumsecurity.com) doing a bit of everything, but mostly Application, Mobile, and Cloud Security. Follow/Reach me on [mastodon - @Fatzombi@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@Fatzombi) or [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/fz42).

I sometimes publish blog posts on my [blog](https://fatzombi.com).
